## Insight Generation

**1. What is the average occupancy rate in each of the room categories?**

    room_class      occ_pct
    Presidential    59.28
    Premium         58.03
    Elite           58.01
    Standard        57.89
    Name: occ_pct, dtype: float64


The standard, elite, premium, and presidential rooms have occupancy rates of 59.28%, 58.03%, 58.01%, and 57.89%, respectively.
The presidential room has the highest occupancy rate, while the standard room has the lowest occupancy rate.
However, there is not a significant difference in the occupancy rates among these four types of rooms; they all have around 58% of occupancy rate.

**2. What is the average occupancy rate per city?**

    city         occ_pct
    Delhi        61.51
    Hyderabad    58.12
    Mumbai       57.91
    Bangalore    56.33

The result displays that the occupancy rates of Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore are 61.51%, 58.12%, 57.91%, and 56.33%, respectively.
Delhi has the highest occupancy rate, while Bangalore has the lowest occupancy rate.

**3. What are the average occupancy rates for weekdays and weekends, and which one is better, weekdays or weekends?**

    day_type    occ_pct
    weekend     72.34
    weekeday    50.88
    Name: occ_pct, dtype: float64

The average occupancy rate on weekends is significantly greater than on weekdays. The average occupancy rate at weekends and weekdays is 72.34% and 50.88%, respectively.

    To increase the occupancy rate on weekdays and generate more revenue for AtliQ, I have come up with two strategies:**

    Targeted Marketing: Develop a targeted marketing campaign specifically tailored to attract weekday guests, such as highly-promoted weekday offers, special discounts, or discounted rates to incentivize them to choose weekdays for their stay.

    Loyalty Program: Develop a loyalty program that rewards guests for staying on weekdays. Offer exclusive benefits or discounts for repeat weekday and weekend guests to incentivize their loyalty and increase weekday occupancy.


**4. What were the average occupancy rates in different cities in June?**

    city         occ_pct
    Delhi        62.47
    Hyderabad    58.46
    Mumbai       58.38
    Bangalore    56.44
    Name: occ_pct, dtype: float64

The average occupancy rates of Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore in June are 62.47%, 58.46%, 58.38%, and 56.44% respectively.

**5. We got new data for the month of August. Append that to existing data.**

**6. What is the total revenue_realised per city?**

    city         revenue_realised
    Mumbai       668569251
    Bangalore    420383550
    Hyderabad    325179310
    Delhi        294404488

The result indicates the revenue realization in each city, with Mumbai having the highest revenue, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
Mumbai may have a larger market size or higher demand for the services offered by AtliQ, resulting in higher revenue realization compared to other cities.

    To increase the revenue realisation in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi for AtliQ. I have come up with one strategy:

    Partnerships and Collaborations: Build partnerships with local businesses, travel agencies, or event organisers to tap into their networks and attract more 
    customers. Collaborations can result in mutually beneficial marketing opportunities and increase revenue.

**7. What is the month-by-month revenue?**
